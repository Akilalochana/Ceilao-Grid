ðŸ“– Introduction      
In today's fast-paced world, many individuals unknowingly consume vegetables and produce treated with harmful chemicals. Despite the advice to grow vegetables in small spaces to enjoy fresh, chemical-free produce, a gap in understanding persists regarding the benefits of home gardening. This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a solution that empowers individuals to evaluate their available land and make informed decisions about planting, yielding, and selling surplus produce.

Our system not only assists users in planning their gardens efficiently but also promotes sustainable living and offers opportunities to generate additional income through surplus sales.
